The code for Nemesiss 2016 robot , Deadelus 

When setting up just remember to start the **DashBoard** <br>
  This can be done in one of two ways: <br>
    1. If you are in a competition , make sure you are using the **COMPETITION** dashboard, not the  <br> **HTML** DASH <br>
    2. If your in a demo , use the html dashboard , its very nice and pretty , its python or something like that.
